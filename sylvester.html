			<blockkquote cite="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/italian-greyhound#/slide/1"><p><i><font color="gray" face="Arial" size="4">Italian Greyhounds adapt well to apartment life, and they’re loving companions to everyone in the home, including kids and other dogs. Even novice pet parents will fall in love with these easy-to-groom pups. However, they don’t take well to being left alone at home for long hours during the day. They’re highly sensitive and need companionship."</font></i></p></blockquote>
